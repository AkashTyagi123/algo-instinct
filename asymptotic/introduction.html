                <h3 class="title"> Introduction to Asymptotic analysis</h3><span class="date badge badge-warning">Monday, August 1,2020</span>
                <p>
                    Before deep-diving into the notion of Asymptotic analysis, I want to make you understand why do we even need to study this topic. Think about how we measure things in the real world, for instance how to we measure the speed of a car,  the weight of a person, and the temperature of a room. The answers to the above questions are quite simple we have different units to measure different quantities. For example, to measure speed we have defined a unit known as km/h, the weight of a person is measured in Kg, and the temperature is measured in degree celsius or sometime in Fahrenheit. These units define how one thing is different from others in a way that one is good and one is bad. We being a programmer deals with a variety of algorithms as a part of our daily routine so it becomes really important to choose one algorithm over another. But the really tough question is which one to choose and how to choose. This is the place where Asymptotic analysis helps us.
First, let us discuss some of the ideas which can be used to measure the performance of an algorithm then we will look into the idea of asymptotic analysis.
Let us assume that we define the lines of code in a program to be our measure of performance. But, since the different developers can have different ways of writing code in a given particular language we cannot use this parameter as a measure of performance as it may vary from developer to developer.
Now, let us consider the speed of execution as a factor. This approach first seems to be a relevant choice but it is deceptive. We all know that different computers have different processing power so the speed of execution depends on the underlying hardware. So this can also not be used as it will be dependent on the underlying hardware.
Now let us try to understand the idea behind the asymptotic analysis.
Asymptotic analysis means the order of growth of our algorithm concerning input size N. For example if the complexity of our algorithm is O(N<sup>2</sup>) it simples means that if the input time is doubled the time taken would become four times or simply it varies as a quadratic function of input size. Don't worry if you are struggling with this idea now, it will become more clearer as we proceed to the next chapter of this section. Note that in the above example we used <span class="badge badge-warning">Big-O notation </span>we all be discussing these notations in detail in the subsequent chapters.

See you in the subsequent chapters.<br>

Happy coding<br>
