                <h3 class="title"> How to we measure the asymptotic Analysis</h3><span class="date badge badge-warning">Tuesday, August 2,2020</span>
                <p>
                    
                  First of all, I would like to congratulate you on completing your first step. I agree the previous section was a bit boring ðŸ¥´ and full of theoretical stuff.
Here comes a piece of good news for you this section is full of questions and I am sure you will find them interesting.
Let's move on coders...
<br>So the agenda of this article is how do we measure the complexity of an algorithm. A simple trick to perform this task is to count the number of instructions your code executes, formulate it as a function and find the rate of growth of that function. Let's look into some examples regarding the same.
                  <br><br>
                  <h5>Some Guidelines to keep in mind</h5>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Loops:-</strong>
                    The running time of loop is defined as the number of time the loop runs multiplied by the time taken by
                    the instruction inside loop.
<pre>
  <code class="language-java">
//loop executing N times
for(int i=0;i&#x3C;N;i++){
  m=m+2; //constant time operation let the constant time be C
}
  </code>
</pre>
                
    So the total number of instruction executed is N*C. On observing carefully we see that for larger value of n 
    the rate of growth is linear times constant which is also linear. So the complexity is O(N).
                    </li>





                    <li><strong>Nested loops:-</strong> Start computing the complexity from inner loop and move outside.
                      The total complexity is product of complexity of both loop.
                
                      
  <pre>
    <code class="language-java">
  //loop executing N times
  for(int i=0;i&#x3C;N;i++){
    //loop executing m times
    for(int j=0;j&#x3C;M;j++){
    //constant time operation let it be C
      x=x+2;
    }
  }
    </code>
  </pre>
                  
    So the total number of times the inner loop is executing is M and it is having one constant time operation. So, its complexity 
    is O(M*C). Now the outer loop is executing this loop N number of times so the total instructions count would be 
    N*M*C. On larger value of N and M we can negect C as it is a mere constant so its complexity is O(N*M).
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Consecutive statement:-</strong> The complexity would be the sum of complexities of both the statmment.

                  
                        
    <pre>
      <code class="language-java">

        //loop executing N times
        for(int i=0;i&#x3C;N;i++){
          //loop executing m times
          for(int j=0;j&#x3C;M;j++){
          //constant time operation let it be C
            x=x+2;
          }
        }


    //loop executing N times
    for(int i=0;i&#x3C;N;i++){
      //loop executing m times
      for(int j=0;j&#x3C;M;j++){
      //constant time operation let it be C
        x=x+2;
      }
    }
      </code>
    </pre>
     
    The total number of instruction executed by first loop is O(N*C) and total number of instruction executed by second loop is O(N*M*C).
    So the complexity would be O(N*C) + (N*M*C). Talking about the bigger values of N and M we can neglect
    N*M in front of N*M*C.so now our complexity is O(N*M*C). As we know constants never take part in complexity Analysis
    so overall complexity is O(N*M). 


                        </li>
  
                        <li><strong>Logarithmic:-</strong> The complexity would be the number of time the loop runs.

                  
                        
                          <pre>
<code class="language-java">
                      
//loop executing N times
for(int i=1;i&#x3C;N;i*=2){
  x= x+1 // constant time operation
  
}
                      
                      
                         
                            </code>
                          </pre>

                    At first thought you might think that the complexity is of linear order. But watch it out, the 
                    code is deceptive. If you see clearly i is increasing as a factor of 2. If this is the case then
                    loop is for sure not going to run N times. Let us assume it ran for K times and after K times it quits.
                    So in total we perform K iterations.
                    on first iteraton i = 1 and it keeps on going as 2,4,8 . Notice that at any ith iteration
                    i is 2<sup>i</sup>. So after k iteration loops quit and this is the case when testing condition
                    becomes false.This implies 
                    2<sup>k</sup> = N;
                    On solving this we get k = log<sub>2</sub> N.
                    Since k is our number of iterations which eventually is our complexity. So our complexity is 
                    O(log<sub>2</sub> N).
                  
                           
                          
                      
                                              </li>
                  
                  </ol>
                  <span class="badge badge-danger">Note</span><span class="note">
                    It is worth observing that the instructions which are not dependent on input size do 
                    not contribute to our overall complexity and they are called as constant time operations.
                    Since this time differ from system to system we usually denote such operation as 
                    O(1) time complexity.
                    
                  </span><br>

                  That was to much to digest. Take your time to understand this stuff and I will see you in next section. 
                  Till then stay calm and code.
                  <br>
                  Cheer!<br>
                  Happy Coding<br>
